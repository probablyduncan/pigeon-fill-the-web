        <p class="arrow-indent">This is a website about a book about pigeons.</p>
        <p>The book is about doing something good, once, and trying to do it again, and forgetting how hard it was to do it the first time.</p>
        <p>When I made it, I was thinking a lot about my past photography. I had spent a year away from my camera, and when I picked it back up, my new work felt flat. I felt like I'd lost my touch.</p>
        <p>This was most evident in the skies of my new pictures.</p>
        <p>My old photography was full of birds. There were birds on telephone poles, birds strutting down gutters and gables, birds among the clouds, between the trees, and in the corners of the sky.</p>

        <p>And in my new pictures, the skies were all empty.</p>
        
        <img src="/public/i/bigempty.webp" />

        <p>I thought I had lost my touch, but really I just wasn't being patient. In that year of inaction, of looking back without moving forward, I had forgotten that good pictures are hard work. You have to keep showing up.</p>

        <h2>Returning</h2>

        <p>I made the book in 2024, and decided it needed a website almost exactly a year after it was finished.</p>
        
        <p>I'm really proud of the book. It's an extremely satisfying to have such a hefty manifestation of an art that lives mostly on hard drives. It's physicality is one of the things that I love most about it. It's a pleasing object.</p>

        <p>But often, whenever anybody asked to see it, I would have to send them the <span class="small-caps">Pdf</span>, instead of a copy of the actual book. It felt flat. A <span class="small-caps">PDF</span>, like <span class="small-caps">DEATH</span>, is a great equalizer. A <span class="small-caps">PDF</span> doesn't do anything justice.</p>
        <p>I thought to myself: <i>I'm a programmer; wouldn't it be fun to turn this into a website?</i></p>
