        <p>This is a website about a book about pigeons.</p>
        <p>The book is about doing something good, once, and trying to do it again, and forgetting how hard it was to do it the first time.</p>
        <p>The website, I suppose, is about the same thing.</p>
        <p>I made the book in 2024, and decided it needed a website almost exactly a year after it was finished.</p>
        <p>When I made the book, I was thinking a lot about my old photography, and feeling like my newer work wasn't as good.</p>
        <p>When I was making this website, I just wanted it over and done. I had a lot of fun, and I learned a lot, don't get me wrong, but I already did this project! And here I was, doing it all over again.</p>
        <p>I guess I thought that adaptation was much less of a creative process than making something from scratch. That's certainly not true.</p>
