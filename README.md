first I need to mock up the whole length of the thing with images text etc not worrying too much about layout

then I need to get the layouts done for mobile/etc

and I need to figure out how the text will be displayed

then I need to work on animations/effects not worrying too much about file size/performance

finally I need to do some optimization and tighten things up

also attribute tom's new roman!!

ideas:

page number in the corner lol

noise gradient top of title area mimicking film grain

try speech bubble instead of star icon for starting subtitles

images appears normal width at first but gets wider as you scroll down like pryamid chat
