This is the source of [To Pigeon-Fill the Sky (the Website)](https://pigeons.duncanpetrie.com), a photographic storybook about the creative process, AI art, and, of course, pigeons.

It's a digital adaptation of To Pigeon-Fill the Sky (the Book), which you can read about [here](https://pigeons.duncanpetrie.com/book).

This site was built in August, 2025, with vite (yay!), tailwind (ugh), and gsap (yay!).

The code is not great. It's mostly in `website.html`, `website.css`, and `website.ts`. I would not recommend looking at it!

The images are all my own. Some of them have been added to using Photoshop's generative fill tool. You can read about this process at `/about` and `/book`.

Most of the site is set in Times New Roman, but I used [tom7](http://tom7.org/)'s incredible [Tom's New Roman](http://fonts.tom7.com/fonts93.html) for my scrappy descent into ai-pigeon-hell.

The grid lines were inspired by [lucie.tokyo](https://lucie.tokyo), which does them much better, I think. When I have more time I'd like to come back and play around with a more dynamic background.
